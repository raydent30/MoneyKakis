MoneyKakis is a bill-spliting app that makes it easy for your and your friends to track shared expenses. To get
started, head to the "manage groups" tab and join an existing group or create a new one — you'll need to know
your group's passcode, or you'll need to create one, depending on whether you're joining or creating a group.
Note that there are no restrictions on the number of groups you can join or create, or on how many members a
group can have. Once you have joined at least one group, your dashboard will list all groups of which you are a
member. From your dashboard you can access information about each of your groups, including a log of all expenses,
which includes information about the person who paid for each expense and how much money you owe or are owed as a
result of it. To add expenses, simply click the "add expense" button corresponding to the group you wish to add the
expense to and fill out the necessary details. You and your group mates' dashboards will be updated to reflect the
addition of the new expense. To leave a group of which you are a member, navigate to the "manage groups" tab and
scroll to the bottom of the page to find the "leave group" button. You will need to enter the ID of the group you
wish to leave. Note that in order to leave a group, that group must have no outstanding expense — once an expense
has been settled, use the "settle up" button to delete that expense from your group.
